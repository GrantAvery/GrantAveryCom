      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m a software developer currently attending Davenport University. 
        I build websites and mobile apps for Spectrum Health and others, 
        and am always learning new things.
      </p>

      <p>I am passionate about developing my interests, 
        which include computer programming, web design, literature, 
        photography, technology, and much more. 
        I am already versed in C#/.NET and Java programming, 
        as well as front-end HTML and CSS. 
        I've also been broadening my competence in Javascript 
        (mostly Angular along with some jQuery, React, and vanilla) 
        and front-end enhancements like Sass styling. 
        In addition to web development, I have experience programming 
        iOS and Android mobile apps.
